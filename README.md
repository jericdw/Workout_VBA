# Workout_VBA

This workout program is a personal project where I'm opening up for other people to comment or contribute. Given it's developed with Excel/VBA, one needs to download the Excel file "Eric's Workout Tracker_11FEB23.xlsx" and the text file "Workout_Program.txt". On personal devices, you may create your .xlsm, but I choose to separate it on the repository to have all the code on one sheet. 

Below is a function diagram looking at inputs and outputs and how they relate. Some functions are underdeveloped in the code, but important ones are depicted here.

Naming conventions were personalized and probably need to be refactored to be a serious project. I'm in the process (eventually) of converting this to C# and thinking through object oriented programming techniques to better handle the data and from multiple users. If you look at "Workout_Blazor" that is a template slightly modified to test the SQLite database before I begin doing any of the logic developed in this program.
